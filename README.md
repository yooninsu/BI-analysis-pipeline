# BI-analysis-pipeline


This project provides a simple and scalable REST API using FastAPI to run common bioinformatics analysis pipelines. 
It is designed to give biologists and researchers fine-grained control over their analyses by exposing key parameters and options, moving beyond a simple web interface to enable detailed, reproducible workflows.

Features
- Asynchronous by Design: Built with FastAPI for high performance.
- Background Tasks: Long-running analyses (like DADA2 or DESeq2) are run as background tasks, so the API remains responsive.
- Modular Pipelines: Easily extendable to add more analysis pipelines (e.g., Shotgun Metagenomics).
- Simple Job Tracking: Users can submit a job and receive a unique job_id to track its status.
- Automatic Documentation: Interactive API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI (via Swagger UI).
